# onlineexaminationsystem

This system is developed using Java and MySQL.

This is a system for conducting examinations both objective and subjective type for students. The objective type of test subjects are Quantitative and Logical Reasoning. The subjective test is based on Personality Development. The grading for the subjective test is performed using Stanford CoreNLP which uses Natural Language Processing to evaluate the answers and grade according to defined criteria. The marks are displayed after the test is submitted. This is a single integrated system for both students and teachers, where the teachers can also use it for directly recording student marks as well as analyse the results through graphs (implemented using JFreeCharts). Thus the system is simple, complete and efficient.
